## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The portfolio can be easily containerized and run locally or on a server using Docker.

### Requirements
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed on your system.

### Option 1: Docker CLI

**Build the image:**
```bash
docker build -t anish-portfolio .
```

**Run the container:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name anish-portfolio anish-portfolio
```

**Access the website:**
Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`

**Stop the container:**
```bash
docker stop anish-portfolio
docker rm anish-portfolio
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker logs anish-portfolio
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Start the container:**
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
This will build the image and run the container in the background. Access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

**View running containers:**
```bash
docker ps
```

**Stop the container:**
```bash
docker compose down
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **`port 8080 already in use`**: If another service is using port 8080, change the mapping in the run command or `docker-compose.yml`. For example, use `-p 8081:80`.
- **`Docker daemon not running`**: Ensure Docker Desktop is open and running on your machine.
- **`assets not loading`**: Clear your browser cache or perform a hard refresh (`Ctrl + F5`). The container uses Nginx with caching headers.
- **`container immediately stopping`**: View the logs using `docker logs anish-portfolio` to see if there's an Nginx configuration error.
- **`Windows firewall/network access issues`**: If accessing from another device on the same network, make sure your Windows Firewall allows incoming connections on port 8080.
